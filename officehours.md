# Office Hours

## Professor Simpkins's Office Hours, CoC 133

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 17:00-18:00 in CoC 133 or CoC 107. Any time my office door is open, feel free to walk in. Email me if you need to see me, even during office hours since I won't necessarily be in my office or the TA lab if I'm not expecting anyone.
